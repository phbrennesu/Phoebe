              <h3>Hybrids</h3>
              <p>Hybrid dogs are an intentional mix of two purebred dogs. The  most popular hybrid dog is a Yorkipoo,the mix of a Yorkshire Terrior and a Poodle.
                    Other popular hybrid dogs are Cockapoos and Buggs. My family chose to get a Golden Doodle because we like the temperment of Golden Retrievers but wanted a dog that would not shed.  
                    According to purebred.com, hybrid dogs have grown increasingly popular because owners know exaclty what they are getting. 
                    A hybrid dog was perfect for my family because my brother is allergic to dogs. Kori is the perfect addition to our family. 
                </p>
                <p>Hybrid dogs might resemble one parent breed over another. Even the same kind hybrid dogs from differnt parent dogs could look different
                    A first generation hybrid dog is when the parents are both purebred dogs. Moreover, A second generation hybrid dog is when 
                the parents are both hybrid dogs themselves.  </p>

              <h3>Popular Hybrids</h3>
                      <p class="sub"> Hybrids have grown in popularity over the years because they combine different traits that people love in a breed. For example, a golden doodle combines the friendly nature 
                          of a golden retriever with the intelligence and hypoallergenic coat of a poodle. The most popular hybrid dog breeds according to dog.com are:  
                      </p>
                     <ol>
                          <li>Cockapoo</li>
                          <li>Labradoodle</li>
                          <li>Goldendoodle</li>
                          <li>Maltese Shih Tzu</li>
                          <li>Puggle</li>
                          <li>Schnoodle</li>
                          <li>Yorkipoo</li>
                         
                      </ol>
                  <p class="sub"> Breeder Wally Conron first created the labradoodle because he was looking to create a guide dog for a women whose husband was
                      allergic to dogs. He said that he now feels a sense of responsibility for the growth of hybrid dogs especially from unethical breeders
                      who are unaware of what they are doing. The importance of a good breeder is important no matter the type of dog. 
                      Always make sure to do your research when you are getting a dog from a breeder.

<h3>Mutts</h3>
<p>Mutts are mixes of different breeds and cannot be identified as one breed. Mutts do not belond to one offically recognized breed.
    Most Americans believe that Purebreds are the most popular dog, but in fact Mutts are the most commonly own dog in the United States.
    Angela Hughes, veterinary genetics research manager at Mars Veterinary explains Mutt trends, “the DNA of America’s mixed-breed dogs tells a story of which breeds were popular in past decades. If a breed was trendy in the past, but has fallen from popularity, it may still represent a large portion of the current mixed-breed population.” 
</p>
<p>
    Why adopt a mutt? By adopting a mutt, you are saving a life. Mutt dogs are also reported to have more diverse personalities. Your mutt dog will be more unique in comparison to purebred and hybrid dogs. 
    Mutts are also more resistant to genetic diseases. This means that mutts live longer and are stronger than their furry friends. 
    A mutt can make a great addition to your family! Check out shelters in your area for dogs that are in need of a loving home.

 <h3>About Helping Hounds</h3>
            <p class="sub"> Helping Hounds Dog Rescue is a non-profit organization located in Syracuse, NY. 
                The organization's mission is to help dogs in over crowded shelters find loving homes.  
                Before adopting a dog, Helping Hounds says you should consider the following:
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Can you make a 10 to 15 year financial commitment?  </li>
                        <li>Who will care for your dog when you are not at home?</li>
                        <li>Is anyone in your household allergic to pets?</li>
                        <li> Can you walk, feed, and train your dog?</li>

                </ol>
               <p class="sub">
                   Rescuing a dog can have many benefits on the dog and the owner. Often, people 
                   who rescue dogs jokingly ask themsevles "Who rescued who?" It can be especially important to look 
                   out for older dogs in shelters becaue they are often overlooked for 
                   younger puppies. Older dogs can be just as fullfilling as puppies and often need 
                    less training. By adopting a dog from a shelter, you are saving animals from being euthanized. Adopting
                    a dog from a shelter also opens up more space for the shelter to care for more animals.

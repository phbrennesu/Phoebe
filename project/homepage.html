<p>Dogs have been coined as man's bestfriend for for over 30,000 years. According to the Telegraph UK, the relationship between dogs and humans evolved from wolves and humans scavanged together in South East Asia and the rest is history! Just kidding! Scientists are still researching more and more everyday about the origins of dogs and different breeds. Nonetheless, no matter their origins, dogs continue to bring joy to people's lives everyday.</p>
  <p> Below you will find my own dog Kori on the far right with her friend Jersey in the middle and her other friend Simba on the left. This website highlights the loving relationship between humans and dogs. 
  Dogs bring joy to millions of people across the globe everyday.

      <h2>History of Dogs</h2>
      <section class="row">
          <article class="col">
      <p> According to ABC News and Sweedish Genecist Pontus Skoglund, the relationship between
        humans and dogs began as long as 40,000 years ago! Scientists like Skoglund believe that dogs became attracted to humans
      because of the scraps of food that they left behind. It is easy to believe that not much has changed since then! 
    My dog Kori loves eating scraps from the table. Her favorite foods are chicken soup, cheese, and carrots. She loves to eat whatever we are eating. 
  There is more that explains the love between a human and a canine. When a dog and a person make eye contact, 
the hormone oxytocin is released. Oxytocin can help people and pets strengthen their bonds.</p>
<p>
According to National Geographic, all dogs can be traced back to a wolf. Evidence of such is seen through the way domestic dogs are 
territoral and communication through scent. Besides scent, National Geographic reports that dogs also use their body language to communciate. 
This can include when a dog wags its tail or when it barks. Despite not being able to talk, dogs extremely intelligent animals and are still able to communicate with humans and other animals. 
Besides being a best friend, dogs can work in fields such as police forces and security. The bonds that dogs and humans share are mutually beneficial. Many people, including myself, would be lost without their furry friends. 
I hope this website helps pet owners appreciate their dogs even more than they already do.
